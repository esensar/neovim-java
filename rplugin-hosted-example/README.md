# Remote hosted plugin example

This module represents simple example of a hosted remote plugin. This plugin can only be run together with `plugins-common-host`, by starting the `plugins-common-host` with this project in classpath.

It should be possible to then call the `:NeovimJavaIncrementCount` command which communicated with java plugin.
